# harnesses

A lightweight collection of open-source coding agent repos, tracked as git submodules.
This exists mainly for learning and reference purposes, so I can pull everything in one place.

Docs in this repo:
- `claude-dotfile-setup.md`
- `codex-dotfile-setup.md`
- `eigent-architecture.md`
- `opencode-architecture.md`
